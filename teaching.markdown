# Teaching
-----------------

### (Spring 2021) ORIE 4740 Statistical Data Mining:
One of two TA's for a class of ~75 students. Held office hours, taught lab sessions focusing on data analysis in R, and helped write and grade assignments/exams. Here is my favorite student comment from my mid-semester TA evaluation "Explains difficult concepts very well. Makes difficult HW/lab questions look easy. Teaches for mastery rather than just a test score"  :')
