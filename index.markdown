# Welcome!

I am a second year PhD student in Operations Research at Cornell and am interested in decision making under uncertainty. I completed my undergraduate studies in math/stats/OR at UNC Chapel Hill. I am fortunate to be working with [Shane Henderson](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/shane/) on simulation optimization.

Whether you're an ambitious high-schooler looking for advice or someone looking to brainstorm or collaborate on a project, please feel free to contact me using the information below.
